      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>During my bachelor years, I passed the National Computer Level II Examination and learned computer knowledge(C language) as well. As a student with First Class Honors and an average rating of 86.98/100 of Jilin University, which has the titles of "985" and "211" and one of the most prestigious "Top 10" universities in China, I ranked four in entirely academic years and awarded First Class Scholarship and College Excellent Student. I have successively published an SCI paper and won the first prize of the National University Student Innovation Program. My academic competence could also be exemplified by two bioinformatics projects' Funding of Chinese Academy of Sciences Science, and I believe I have already possessed excellent research ability to start a master study. During my internship in both GUANGZHOU INSTITUTES OF BIOMEDICINE AND HEALTH.CAS and KUNMING INSTITUTE OF ZOOLOGY.CAS, I learned how to use Dawning Server in Supercomputer Center, how to analyze big data of bioinformatics, how to use the programming language to solve scientific research problems, and how to make a clear presentation for my research progress with ppt. All these effort and persistence from my part gave me a solid foundation of analysis.

During the summer holidays of 2107 and 2018, I was allowed going to two different Institutes of CAS as a temporary research assistant, during which my determination to pursue further study on Data science had been strengthened. As for my work during the internship, pre-processing steps used Perl and Python as the advanced natural language processing techniques to extract better features from clean data, and next step we were using Bash language to submit, manage the job as well as build a continuous integration pipeline by Integrating with other software. As for data processing, we most frequently used the genetic formula, PCA, t-SNE algorithm to convert data into bio-information. Finally, in the project, we consider what type of visualization to use for specific objectives and create images that clearly show the features of the stories in R. During this period, I have gained previous experience in processing high volumes of low-density, which enabled me to emphasize real-world data science applications and business analysis rather than biology.</p>
      <p>    After graduating from undergraduate school, I received qualifications for postgraduate application, PhD admission from the University of Macau and full scholarship funding. My research project at the time was to investigate the mechanism of triple-negative breast cancer by single-cell transcriptome sequencing. In the lab's pre-internship, I found that I was more eager to solve problems that are more specific, more practical, and can change the world. So after consulting with my supervisor, I gave up my current PhD research. He told me before I left that once you decide not to look back and hesitate, the right direction will guide you. So I came to Nottingham and started my master's degree in business analysis and achieved excellent results in scientific research and learning. I like the business school environment very much, but I don't hate experiments.
On the contrary, the experimental skills and good scientific spirit accumulated in the field of biology make me more inclined to study the essence behind the problem. Combining what I have learned and researched, I have become more and more convinced that there is always a corresponding biological mechanism behind business behaviour. This discovery has convinced me of my future research direction.</p>
